# .codex/PR-19.md — World Subscriptions + Summary Advertisement

## Goal
Implement subscription intents and summary advertisement in swarm layer so peers can discover
which worlds to sync and which summaries exist.

## Deliverables
- Define `WorldSubscription` model (world key patterns, interest kinds).
- Add gossip messages:
  - `Hello` (node id, served worlds, subscriptions)
  - `SummaryAdvert` (world, summary windows available, digest)
- Add local “summary catalog” API in engine (read-only) used by swarm.
- Update membership peer info to store advertised summaries.

## Tests
- Hello merge behavior (idempotent updates).
- Summary advert updates catalog and is queryable.

## Acceptance
- Two nodes can exchange Hello + SummaryAdvert over transport in an integration test harness.
