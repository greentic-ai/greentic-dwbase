# .codex/PR-16.md — Developer & User Documentation with Examples

## Codex Execution Rules
- Documentation must match the implemented API, not the aspirational spec.
- Prefer runnable examples over prose.
- Keep examples minimal and copy-pasteable.

## Goal
Provide clear, practical documentation for **developers** and **users** of DWBase v1, including worked examples.

This PR makes DWBase usable without reading the full spec.

## Deliverables

### A) High-level docs
Create / expand:
- `README.md`
- `docs/overview.md`

Cover:
- What DWBase is (in 1 page)
- Core concepts: Atom, World, remember/ask/observe/replay
- What DWBase is *not* (not a DB, not a vector store)

### B) Developer documentation
Create:
docs/developer/
architecture.md
engine.md
storage.md
vector.md
security.md
wit.md

markdown
Copy code

Each doc:
- 1–2 pages max
- references concrete crates and types
- includes small diagrams or ASCII flows (Mermaid optional)

### C) User-facing examples
Create:
examples/
basic_memory/
observe_stream/
replay_simulation/
worlds_and_forks/

markdown
Copy code

Each example must include:
- `README.md` explaining scenario
- runnable Rust code or CLI commands
- expected output

At least one example must:
- remember observations
- ask a question
- show trust/importance affecting results

### D) WASM / WIT examples
Add:
examples/wasm-worker/

markdown
Copy code

Include:
- minimal WASM worker using `dwbase-wit-guest`
- remember + ask example
- build instructions

### E) CLI documentation
Document:
- `dwbase-cli ask`
- `dwbase-cli replay`
- `dwbase-cli list-worlds`

With real command examples.

## Constraints
- Do not introduce new APIs just for docs.
- Keep docs aligned with v1.0 feature set.
- Avoid marketing language; be precise.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new user can follow README + examples and successfully run:
  - remember
  - ask
  - observe
- Docs compile cleanly (if using mdbook or similar).
