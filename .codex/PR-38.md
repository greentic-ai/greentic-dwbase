# .codex/PR-38.md — Greentic Pack: component-dwbase + Demo Flow (“LLM Long-term Memory”)

## Goal
Provide a ready-to-install `.gtpack` containing `component-dwbase` plus a demo flow that proves long-term memory for an LLM.

## Deliverables
- Create a pack under `packs/dwbase-memory/` (or Greentic pack layout).
- Include:
  - component-dwbase artifact reference
  - flow: `memory_demo`
    - step 1: remember key facts from input
    - step 2: ask memory before responding
    - step 3: write a summary atom
- Provide default config:
  - sets data dir
  - points to NATS
  - sets tenant namespace behavior

## Acceptance
- Pack builds successfully.
- Running the flow shows memory persistence across runs.
