# .codex/PR-13.md — Metrics + Health (dwbase-metrics)

## Goal
Add instrumentation and basic health indicators for self-management loops.

## Deliverables
In `crates/dwbase-metrics`:
- tracing + metrics façade
- counters/histograms:
  - remember latency
  - ask latency
  - index freshness
  - GC evictions (placeholder)
  - trust distribution snapshot
- integrate with engine/node (behind feature flags)

## Tests
- unit tests that metrics can be emitted without panics
