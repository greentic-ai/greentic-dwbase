# .codex/PR-37.md — Observe Streams for Flows (start/poll/stop) + NATS Broadcast Option

## Goal
Expose observe streams in a way that works naturally inside Greentic flows and optionally across nodes.

## Deliverables
- Tool operations:
  - `dwbase.observe_start(filter) -> handle`
  - `dwbase.observe_poll(handle, max) -> atoms`
  - `dwbase.observe_stop(handle)`
- Local behavior:
  - observe streams emit locally remembered + remotely ingested atoms
- Optional cross-node:
  - if enabled, nodes may publish a compact “atom event” to NATS per subscribed world
  - ensure rate limits + batching

## Tests
- Start observe; remember atoms; poll receives them in order.
- Ingested remote atoms also appear.

## Acceptance
- Works reliably with poll semantics in WASM environment.
