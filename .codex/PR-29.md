# .codex/PR-29.md — Soak, Chaos & Partition Testing (Scale Confidence)

## Goal
Add long-running soak tests and failure injection to validate stability at scale.

## Deliverables
- Soak test harness:
  - mixed workload (remember+ask+observe+sync)
  - runs 10–30 minutes locally (configurable)
- Failure injection:
  - kill/restart node process
  - corrupt tail segment (expected recovery)
  - network partition simulation in devnet (swarm)
- Reports:
  - p50/p95 latencies
  - memory/disk growth
  - index freshness
  - sync lag

## Constraints
- Soak tests should be excluded from default CI; run via separate command.

## Acceptance
- `dwbase test soak --duration 5m` works and produces a report file.
