# .codex/PR-44.md — dwbase-memory Pack: Align Flow/Pack Schema with Canonical Greentic Runner

## Goal
Ensure `packs/dwbase-memory` is “drop-in runnable” with the real Greentic pack/flow runner and not just a best-effort JSON placeholder.

## Deliverables
- Replace `packs/dwbase-memory/pack.json` and `flows/memory_demo.json` with the canonical Greentic schema (as required by the actual runner).
- Add a minimal host-side integration test (or harness script) that:
  - loads the pack
  - executes the flow twice with the same `DWBASE_DATA_DIR`
  - verifies persistence via a second-run memory lookup
- Document exact CLI commands for:
  - installing pack
  - running flow
  - configuring env/secrets

## Constraints
- No cloud dependencies required for local demo.

## Acceptance
- The demo flow runs successfully with the real Greentic runner.
- Persistence is observable across runs.
