# .codex/PR-28.md — Observability: Operator-Grade Metrics, Tracing, Health

## Goal
Promote observability from “dev metrics” to “production operations”.

## Deliverables
- Metrics endpoints (choose one):
  - Prometheus `/metrics` over HTTP
  - OTLP exporter config
- Health endpoints:
  - `/healthz` (liveness)
  - `/readyz` (readiness: storage ok, indexes usable, disk ok)
- Tracing:
  - correlation id per request
  - spans for remember/ask/replay/sync

## Tests
- Health endpoints return expected status.
- Metrics endpoint responds and includes key counters/histograms.

## Acceptance
- Operators can reliably detect degraded node state.
