# .codex/PR-06.md — Reflex Index (Hot Memory) in Engine

## Goal
Implement the RAM-resident Reflex Index for sub-ms filtering of recent/high-importance atoms.

## Deliverables
In `dwbase-engine` (or a new helper module crate if cleaner):
- `ReflexIndex` with:
  - constant-time append
  - filters: by world/kind/labels/author/min-importance/since/exclude-flags
- Recency buckets:
  - store last N seconds/minutes buckets (configurable defaults)

## Tests
- Filtering correctness
- Exclude flags works
- Since cutoff works

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reflex index used by engine ask() pre-filter hook (even if ask logic still stubbed).
