# .codex/PR-35.md — World Subscriptions + Selective Replication via NATS

## Goal
Enable nodes to subscribe to worlds and replicate only what they care about (production essential).

## Deliverables
- Add subscription intent model:
  - explicit world keys and/or simple patterns (e.g. `incident:*`)
- NATS subject mapping for world replication:
  - `dwbase.world.<world_key>.summary`
  - `dwbase.world.<world_key>.atoms`
  - OR keep all replication on per-node inbox messages (simpler); document choice.
- Implement selective replication:
  - only sync worlds that are subscribed
  - do not leak worlds a node lacks capability to read

## Tests
- Node A writes to world X; Node B subscribes to X; Node C does not.
- Only Node B ingests atoms.

## Acceptance
- Replication is correct and respects subscription rules.
