# .codex/PR-32.md — Greentic Component Manifest + Schemas for LLM Tooling

## Goal
Make `component-dwbase` *drop-in usable* inside Greentic flows by providing a proper component manifest and JSON schemas for each tool operation.

## Deliverables
- Add `component.manifest.json` (or Greentic’s expected manifest name) in the component repo root (or `crates/component-dwbase/` packaging dir).
- Define tool operations with:
  - name
  - description
  - input schema
  - output schema
- Provide canonical schemas for:
  - Atom input (new-atom)
  - Atom output
  - Ask question + filters
  - Replay request
  - World list

## Constraints
- Schemas must match DWBase types exactly (no aspirational fields).
- Keep payload as JSON string for v1.

## Acceptance
- `greentic-component` tooling (or your test harness) can load the manifest and expose operations.
- Schemas are stable and documented.
