# .codex/PR-49.md — Storage Performance: Fast get_by_ids + Optional Secondary Index

## Goal
Reduce the “scan across worlds” costs in sled storage and improve query performance at scale.

## Deliverables
- Implement a secondary index:
  - `atoms_by_id/{id} -> (world, seq)` or equivalent
- Update `get_by_ids` to use the index first, fall back to scan only if missing.
- Add a migration path:
  - build index on startup or via `dwbase storage reindex`
- Add benchmarks or micro-tests showing improvement.

## Acceptance
- `get_by_ids` does not scan the whole store in normal operation.
